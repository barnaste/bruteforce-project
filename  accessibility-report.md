## Accessibility Report

1. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:

    (a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or

    (b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

   **Equitable Use**: Every user in the program have access to the same features. In particulars, features promoting privacy such as deleting their account, making the plants they upload private, and creating private accounts are equally available.

   **Flexibility in Use**: The program accommodates both users who wish to maintain a private gallery of their plants and users who wants to share images of their plants. In the future, the program can also implement a setting so that some users can make the icons larger / smaller if they have visual impairments.

   **Simple and Intuitive Use**: The program's navigation is minimalistic; the user goes directly from the login / signup to the main view. All the buttons are clearly labelled with their purpose and the user can identify all the supported features of the program without going through menus.

   **Perceptible Information**: When deleting a user's account, the text has been colored red to alert the user that it is an important action that they are doing. In the future, the program can also implement more color features to color code image deletion.

   **Tolerance for Error**: When the user attempts to delete their account, a popup will be created for them to confirm their credentials before deleting. This reduces the chance for a user's account to be accidentally or maliciously deleted. In further development, implementing a 'trash' folder can also prevent plants from being accidentally deleted though this is much less hazardous.

   **Low Physical Effort**: Our program is essentially a gallery that the user can use at their own pace. Naturally, this requires little physical effort so this does not apply.

   **Size and Space for Approach and Use**: This does not apply to our program because our program is purely software and has no impact on the user's physical environment.

2. Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

3. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.
