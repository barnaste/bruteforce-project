Plantinarium makes identifying plants easy and fun. Just upload a photo, and the system will identify the species for you. It’s more than just identification—you can share your discoveries and add notes or fun facts about the plants you encounter.

This project was built for plant enthusiasts, gardeners, students, and researchers who want a simple way to learn about plants and share knowledge with others. By automating plant identification, Plantinarium saves time and makes it easier to document and explore the world of plants, whether for education, gardening, or pure curiosity.
